## Change history

April 2017

* Initial version.

## Prerequisites

* A trusted web server to host the sample files. The server must be able to accept SSL-protected requests (https) and have a valid SSL certificate.
* An Office 365 email account.
* Enable the on send feature - by default, the on send functionality is disabled. Add-ins for Outlook on the web that use the on send feature will run for users who are assigned an Outlook on the web mailbox policy that has the **OnSendAddinsEnabled** flag set to **true**.  Administrators can enable on send by running Exchange Online PowerShell cmdlets. To learn what cmdlets to run, see [Installing Outlook add-ins that use on send](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/add-ins/outlook-on-send-addins#installing-outlook-add-ins-that-use-on-send)

## Configuring and installing the sample

1. Download or fork the repository.
2. Open app.js. In  `addCCOnSend` function, change `Contoso@contoso.onmicrosoft.com` to your own email address.
2. Deploy the add-in files to a directory on your web server. The files to upload are app.js and index.html.
3. Open `Contoso Message Body Checker.xml` and `Contoso Subject and CC Checker.xml` manifest files in a text editor. Replace all instances of `https://localhost:3000` with the HTTPS URL of the directory where you uploaded the files in the previous step. Save your changes.
